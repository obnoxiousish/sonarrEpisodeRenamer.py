If you have some anime that is like "SERIES/SERIES SEASON 2/SERIES EPISODE 1" it changes it to "SERIES/SERIES SEASON2/SERIES S02E01" so that it can be detected in Sonarr properly. Usually it detects first season fine and fails on the rest. This makes it detect all seasons without breaking qbittorrent or using extra space.
